Select only one file from those three, matching your project's rendering pipeline:
[BUILT-IN] RM *material name here* - for project on Built-in rendering pipeline.
[HDRP] RM *material name here* - for project on High Definition Rendering Pipeline (HDRP).
[URP] RM *material name here* - for project on Universal Rendering Pipeline (URP).

Double click on selected file to install pipeline-specific materials/demo scene/textures.

After installation is done - delete those three files.
Do not install all 3 files in one project, only one is needed.

If all installed materials are pink usually this means wrong rendering pipeline, like installing Built-in materials to URP project.
